pyLSA and Visual Testing

This Class calculates Non-Linear Second-Order Transfer functions as mechanical vibrations. 

This repo contains an example video attached for a visual perspective of the algorithm behavior by simulating a dynamic suspended mass-load: **pylsa_exito_success_11.mkv** and **RAW WORKING.gif** (see Repo).
This class can be used within a mechanical waves environment to create and simulate mechanical waves or perturbations.
